🚗 Used Car Price Prediction
📌 Overview
This project aims to predict the prices of used cars using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation to assist users in estimating the market value of a car based on its features such as brand, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more.

📊 Problem Statement
The resale value of a car depends on various factors, and estimating it accurately is a challenge. The goal is to create a model that can predict the selling price of a used car based on historical data.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Model training

Streamlit (optional) – Web-based UI for prediction

🧪 Machine Learning Models Used
Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor (optional for improvement)

GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

📈 Workflow
Data Collection – Load dataset

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understand correlations and patterns

Preprocessing – Handle missing values, encode categoricals, feature scaling

Modeling – Train/test split, fit models

Evaluation – R² score, MAE, RMSE

Deployment (optional) – Streamlit app for real-time prediction

✅ Results
Achieved R² score of ~0.88 using Random Forest

Streamlit interface allows users to input car features and get predicted price
